Welcome to my repository for the HackBio Internship 2024, a collaborative and immersive experience to advance bioinformatics skills through real-world data projects.


# About HackBio

HackBio is a bioinformatics internship founded to bridge the gap between knowledge and application in computational biology. With a strong focus on mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on learning, HackBio allowed us, aspiring scientists and bioinformaticians, to work on significant projects with real-life implications.


# Internship Track: AMR in Cancer

For this project, my teammates and I worked on the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Cancer track.

Antimicrobial resistance roughly refers to the ability of microbes (_such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites_) to evolve and resist the effects of drugs that were once effective against them. This phenomenon is challenging in cancer treatment, particularly for immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy, where infections caused by resistant pathogens can lead to complications.


# Tools and Software Used

Throughout the internship, Python, R, and Bash were used.


# Overview

### Stage 0: Introduction to Drug Resistance

### Stage 1: Literature Review

### Stage 2: AMR Data Analysis

### Stage 3: AMR Data Analysis and Dashboard Generation

### Stage 4: NGS Pipeline Development

# Collaborators

Shoutout to all my fellow intern-mates who collaborated on this internship!
