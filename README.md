Welcome to my repository for the HackBio Internship 2024, a
collaborative and immersive experience to advance bioinformatics skills
through real-world data projects.

# About HackBio

HackBio is a bioinformatics internship founded to bridge the gap between
knowledge and application in computational biology. With a strong focus
on mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on learning, HackBio allowed us,
aspiring scientists and bioinformaticians,Â to work on significant
projects with real-life implications.

# Internship Track: AMR in Cancer

For this project, my teammates and I worked on the Antimicrobial
Resistance (AMR) in Cancer track.

Antimicrobial resistance roughly refers to the ability of microbes
(*such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites*) to evolve and resist
the effects of drugs that were once effective against them. This
phenomenon is challenging in cancer treatment, particularly for
immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy, where infections
caused by resistant pathogens can lead to complications.

# Tools and Software Used

Throughout the internship, Python, R, and Bash were used.

# Overview

### Stage 0: Introduction to Drug Resistance

### Stage 1: Literature Review

### Stage 2: AMR Data Analysis

### Stage 3: AMR Data Analysis and Dashboard Generation

### Stage 4: NGS Pipeline Development

# Collaborators

Shoutout to all my fellow intern-mates who collaborated on this
internship!
